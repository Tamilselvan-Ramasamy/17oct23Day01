HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
-------------------

HTTP:

 -> HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol.
 -> HTTP is the method computers and servers use to request and send information.
 -> The HTTP protocol did not use headers and only transmitted plain HTML files. 
 -> It was a one-line protocol only supporting the GET method.
 -> As the need to exchange more than just plain HTML emerged along with the client and server applications becoming more mature, HTTP/1.0

HTTPS:

 -> In 1994, Netscape Communications created HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) to be used with SSL for its web browser, Netscape Navigator.
 -> The need for encrypted transmission channels emerged as the applications being designed shifted towards
    a more commercial market where advertisers, unknown individuals, and cybercriminals could have easy access to personal data

HTTP/1.1:

  Version 1.1 was released in 1997 and became the Internet Standard. This version added many performance enhancements,
  including keepalive connections, caching mechanisms, request pipelining, transfer encodings, and byte-range requests.

HTTP/2:

 -> HTTP 2 is the second major version of the HTTP network protocol used for transmitting data over the Internet.
 -> It was developed to improve the performance and efficiency of web applications by reducing the amount of data sent over the wire.

HTTP/2 vs HTTP/1.1:

	HTTP 1.1
       ----------

 Development     :  It was developed in the year 1997
 Compression     :  It compresses data by itself.
 Security        :  A text-based protocol uses plain text to encode and transmit data.
                    The client sends a request to a server, and the server sends a response back to the client.
 Multiplexing    :  A separate connection is established for each request and response, 
                    which can add overhead and latency to the communication process.
 Buffer Overflow :  HTTP 1.1 cannot handle buffer overflow vulnerabilities due to the lack of sufficient measures
 Performance     :  HTTP 1.1 does not include any in-built features, so the performance it delivers is less efficient.


        HTTP/2
       ----------


 Development     : It was developed in the year 2015.
 Compression     : It uses HPACK for data compression
 Security        : It works on the binary protocol as a series of binary codes encode and transmit data rather than plain text.
                   A different underlying protocol called Secure Remote Protocol 2 (SRP2) establishes a secure connection between a client and a server
 Multiplexing    : It allows multiplexing so multiple requests and responses can be sent over a single connection.
 Buffer Overflow : HTTP 2 includes measures to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
 Performance     : HTTP 2 is designed to be more efficient and performant than HTTP 1.1. 
                    This is because HTTP 2 includes several features like multiplexing, binary protocol and header compression.


Conclusion:

 -> HTTP/2 differs from HTTP/1.1 in many ways, with some features providing greater levels of control that can be used to better optimize
   web application performance and other features simply improving upon the previous protocol.
 -> Considering  how such factors as multiplexing, stream prioritization, flow control, server push, and compression in 
    HTTP/2 will affect the changing landscape of web development.
